///// "EVERYTHING IN JS IS AN OBJECT" /////

// Objects in JS are quite like objects in real life
// They have properties and things they can do (methods)

var names = ['ryu', 'crystal', 'mario']

//technically, names will come back as an array that is an object
['ryu', 'crystal', 'mario']
0: 'ryu'
1: 'crystal'
2: 'mario'
length: 3
//if you called names.length, you would get 3

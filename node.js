/// What is Node.js? ///

// allows developers to use JavaScript on the server side (instead of being forced to run it on the client)

// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. The point of the engine is to take JS code
// and compile it down to machine code that your machine can execute.
// The runtime is something that provides custom functionality (tools and libraries)

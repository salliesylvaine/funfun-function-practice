/////  REACT CONCEPTS /////

// 1. Don't touch the DOM, I'll do it.
//     -Document Object Model, what the browser uses to display a web app.
//     JS just manipulates the DOM. It's a tree representation of the page.

/// Declarative vs Imperative

// In an Imperative Paradigm, you directly change individual parts of your app in response to various user events.
// hard to debug

// In Declarative paradigm, react gets a blueprint in the form of a javascript object of how the page should look,
// then react finds the best way to manipulate the DOM. In essence, we declare what the state should be like, and then just make changes
// based on state.
